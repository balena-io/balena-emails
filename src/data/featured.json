Since the <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-4-on-sale-now-from-35/\" target=\"_blank\">release of the Raspberry Pi 4</a> back in June we’ve been working tirelessly to bring support to balenaOS. Our work has resulted in the <a href=\"https://balena.io/blog/balena-releases-first-fully-functional-64-bit-os-for-the-raspberry-pi-4\" target=\"_blank\">first, fully-functional, 64-bit OS for the Raspberry Pi 4</a>, allowing you to <a href=\"https://www.balena.io/blog/run-a-mixed-architecture-app-using-64-bit-balenaos-on-the-raspberry-pi-4/\" target=\"_blank\">mix and match multiple container architectures</a> on this new device.<br><br>In addition to this groundbreaking work, we’ve put together a very detailed account of the <a href=\"https://www.balena.io/etcher/pro/\" target=\"_blank\">EtcherPro</a> development process. We’ve covered the various design challenges and iterations <a href=\"https://www.balena.io/blog/taming-the-hard-in-hardware-in-8-steps/\" target=\"_blank\">in great detail</a> which, in this writer’s opinion, makes for a great read.<br><br>We’ve also finalized the date and opened ticket sales for our <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/iot-workshop-and-hackathon-with-balena-tickets-71040424823\" target=\"_blank\">2019 Hackathon in Barcelona</a>! It’s a great opportunity to get started with balena and meet some of the team you may have chatted to on support or in the forums; we’ll all be there.<br><br>After that we have our usual community contributions, this month showcasing <a href=\"https://medium.com/@tomasmigone/interfacing-raspberry-pi-3-and-arduino-with-remote-monitoring-and-upgradeability-eec512ad3dc2\" target=\"_blank\">management of Arduino devices</a> and a neat <a href=\"https://github.com/ketilmo/balena-ads-b\" target=\"_blank\">flight tracking setup</a>.<br><br>See you next month!",
