      "text": "In 2017, we embarked on a mission to build the <a href=\"https://www.balena.io/etcher/pro/\" target=\"_blank\">ultimate flashing media</a>. As a software company, we didn't realize the hornet's nest that we had stepped into. Little did we anticipate that in the process, we would end up re-examining the wheel at every step, going through eight design iterations and creating our own board from scratch. We share the entire 8 step product development journey in great detail.",

      "text": "Back in May we looked at deploying the software to run a <a href=\"https://www.balena.io/blog/build-a-ttn-lora-gateway-with-balenafin-and-balenacloud/\" target=\"_blank\">balenaFin as a TTN LoRa Gateway</a>, in this post we look at the natural progression from this; mounting the hardware up a mast and making the installation more permanent. The techniques we look at here will allow us to install hardware in a weatherproof enclosure outdoors which can then be used for a variety of applications such as the planned LoRa gateway, or weather monitoring, or ADS-B flight tracking, and any other application where having outdoor hardware is beneficial.",
